# blinkenlights
Blinkenlight code.

## Getting started
Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

If you're on OSX, you need a working Tkinter environment to test your animation.
The easiest way to do that is to install [XQuartz](http://www.xquartz.org/) and
run the example inside XTerm. When you start XQuartz, a new XTerm will pop up.
From there, run the example: `python testbed.py`

Probably need to `sudo apt install libatlas3-base` on raspian.
